    * API services
    * Database queries
    * Complex workflows

## Interface

Initial UI mockup. Subject to change.

A navigation menu on the left-hand side will provide easy access to different interfaces. Buttons within an interface can initiate actions and transmit data, including IDs and text, to other interfaces. An edit mode will allow users to customize the screen layout and modify data payloads.
